# DAR_Packet_Viewer 

DARv3 is a network, packet based standard of accurately timestamped data, comparable to a PCAP file, however there is currently not many tools avaliable to look at packets of data. 

This is a packet viewer to decode and display the binary file data of the DARv3 standard for development and support engineers. It is meant to display all information contained in the currently viewed packet, with several widgets used to navigate the file and save data of interest.
